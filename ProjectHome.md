OpenPort Kit is a framework on Mac OS X enabling automatic port forwarding for routers supporting the Network Address Translation-Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP). The goals are to provide a simple interface for forwarding ports, and determining the public IP address of a router, and good clean-up in error conditions (ie, when an application crashes).

NAT-PMP is currently supported primarily by Apple Computer's Airport Base Stations. However, the protocol is completely documented as a draft from the IETF.

OpenPort Kit requires Mac OS X 10.4 (primarily because of launchd), and Foundation Kit, which is part of Cocoa.
